                                 # ManufactureIQ — Manufacturing Production
# Project Title :
Manufacturing Dataset

## Project Overview :
This project analyzes 1,000 manufacturing records using Microsoft Excel to evaluate production performance, efficiency, quality, downtime, maintenance, costs, revenue, and profit. The project uses Excel formulas and calculated KPIs such as Production Achievement, Availability, Performance, Quality, and OEE, along with PivotTables and PivotCharts to analyze machines, production lines, products, shifts, downtime, maintenance risks, and financial performance. The results are presented through three interactive dashboards with slicers for Month, Production Line, Machine, Shift, and Product Type, helping identify important trends, operational issues, and areas for improvement.

## Tools :
Excel

## Day 3 – Maintenance, Risk, Cost, Profit and Trend Analysis
Created the `Maintenance_Risk` calculated column.
Entered:
`=IF((Y2>25)+(O2>25)+(S2>73)+(T2>2)>=3,"High",IF((Y2>25)+(O2>25)+(S2>73)+(T2>2)=2,"Medium","Low"))`
Filled the formula down.
Created a PivotTable for Maintenance Risk.
Placed `Machine_ID` in Rows.
Placed `Maintenance_Risk` in Columns.
Placed `Record_ID` in Values.
Changed `Record_ID` from `Sum` to `Count`.
This produced High, Medium, and Low maintenance-risk record counts for every machine.
Created the `Anomaly_Flag` column.
Entered:
`=IF(AN2<70%,"Critical",IF(AN2<85%,"Warning","Normal"))`
Filled the formula down.
Created PivotTables to analyze maintenance status against downtime, defect rate, and OEE.
Created `Production_Cost` using the available Raw Material Cost field.
Entered:
`=V2`
